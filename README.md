# News_Reader
Created a python code that read's the top 10 news-headlines. 

 1) First install pyttsx3 module through -pip install pyttsx3 or directly from it's github link https://github.com/nateshmbhat/pyttsx3
 
 2) pyttsx3 is an text to speech module that helps in producing speech format of the news we scrape.
 
 3) Also download requests and BeautifulSoup modules, these modules are used to obtain the news.
 
 4) Now after the installation process run the get_news.py file, this file helps to scrap the news from required website.
 
 5) Make sure to change the file path in the code to the path you want to store the news.
 
 6) Then run the speak.py file and BOOM!
 
 7) Enjoy your daily news over a hot cup of coffee.
